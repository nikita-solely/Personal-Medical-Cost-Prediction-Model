Project Description

In this project, we aim to predict personal medical charges based on individuals' demographic and lifestyle data. The dataset includes various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region of residence. By analyzing these factors, we develop a regression model to estimate the medical costs incurred by individuals.

Project Objectives

To explore the relationship between demographic and lifestyle factors and medical charges.
To develop a linear regression model that predicts medical charges with high accuracy.
To provide valuable insights for insurance companies, healthcare providers, and policymakers to understand cost drivers and allocate resources more effectively.

Methodology

Data Collection: The dataset consists of features like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.
Model Development: Implement a linear regression model using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Results

The linear regression model developed in this project demonstrates strong predictive performance. The model achieved an R² score of 0.7449507093346633, indicating that approximately 74.5% of the variance in medical charges can be explained by the model. On the training data, the model achieved a high R² score of 0.976 with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.023, indicating excellent fit and low prediction error. On the test data, the model maintained good performance with an R² score of 0.830 and an MSE of 0.190, showcasing its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Overall, these results suggest that the model is a robust and reliable tool for predicting medical charges based on the given features.
